We will be creating a basic platform game.  However, there is a twist, there are ridiculous challenges meant to aggravate the player into a fit of despair where they can only continue their lives after beating the game.  The world will be a scrolling map consisting of levels, like Mario.  At the end of each level, there will be power-ups to make previous challenges easier but allows for more in-depth challenges.  

Roles:
Programmer – Tim Villaluz
