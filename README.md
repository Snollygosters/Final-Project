We will be creating a basic platform game.  However, there is a twist, there are ridiculous challenges meant to aggravate the player into a fit of despair where they can only continue their lives after beating the game.  The world will be a scrolling map consisting of levels, like Mario.

The main character in our game will have most of the basic functions that Mario would have in Super Mario. The character will be able to jump, run in both directions, and kill things when it lands on top of them (or has a power up). The purpose of the game will be to complete the level that will have checkpoints as to not completely aggrivate the player. The level will get progressively difficult and the player will also have unlimied lives.

Roles:
*Programmer – Tim Villaluz
*Graphics – Jasmine DuBois
*UI – Chris Markowitz
*QA – Tom Walker 
*Project Management – Rebecca Blitt
