We will be creating a basic platform game. The setting resides in the Union County Vocational-Technical Magnet High School for Mathematics, Science, and Technology. The player will control one of many "Magnet All-Stars" as a character through the "Magnet Adventure".  

The main character in our game will have most of the basic functions that Mario would have in Super Mario. The character will be able to jump, run in both directions, and kill things when it lands on top of them.  Characters will have stats based on speed, jump, and life.

Roles:
*Programmer – Tim Villaluz
*Graphics – Jasmine DuBois
*UI – Chris Markowitz
*QA – Tom Walker 
*Project Management – Rebecca Blitt
