We will be creating a basic platform game.  However, there is a twist, there are ridiculous challenges meant to aggravate the player into a fit of despair where they can only continue their lives after beating the game.  The world will be a scrolling map consisting of levels, like Mario.  At the end of each level, there will be power-ups to make previous challenges easier but allows for more in-depth challenges. 

The main character in our game will have most of the basic functions that Mario would have in Super Mario. The character will be able to jump, run in both directions, and kill things when it lands on top of them (or has a power up). The purpose of the game will be to complete each successive level, which each level getting harder and harder as you go. Within each level, there will be traps and enemies that make it hard to finish. We plan on giving the character unlimited lives.
