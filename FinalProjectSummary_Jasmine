Final Project Summary
	For our final project we were asked to create a game in a group. Our group, the Snollygosters, decided to attempt to create a game similar to Mario. However, we were not able to complete the game due to a lack of time and the overestimation of our own skill.  Our original idea for the game was to have a character menu that allows you to choose one of many characters, which would all be made in Photoshop. After choosing your character you have to go through a scrolling landscape that resembles the halls of our school, jumping on platforms and dodging textbooks. Our final game did not live up to our mighty expectations, lacking the character menu, flying textbooks and ability to die, that we had planned to include. What our final game did have was a scrolling landscape, platforms and a score keeper. We had to change our game a little in order to give it some type of goal, so as you jump on the platforms you collect points. I believe our group has learned from this experience about setting goals that are obtainable. 
	I contributed help on the overall coding of the game. This entailed writing code, helping fix issues with the coding, looking up how to code things and helping decide what functions to use.  I also helped create the preliminary game description and flowchart. Everyone contributed to the project and helped put it together. However, some of the work that was done was not included in the game.
